2. Make sure face is well-lit and visible
3. Transfer to computer
4. Crop to square (1:1 ratio)
5. Resize to 500x500px
6. Save as JPG
```

#### **Option 2: Use Existing Photo**
```
1. Find a good photo of yourself
2. Open in Paint or online editor
3. Crop to square (equal width and height)
4. Resize to 500x500px
5. Save as JPG with correct name
```

#### **Option 3: Use Avatar/Placeholder**
```
If you don't have photos yet:
- Site will show initials (GB, JG, FP)
- Add photos later before finals
- Photos make it more personal!
```

### **File Naming (IMPORTANT!):**
```

John Dominic Gonzales → developer-john.jpg

  - Ginelle: Blue gradient
  - John: Green gradient
  - Franz: Purple gradient

### **Fallback Behavior:**
- If image not found: Shows initials instead
